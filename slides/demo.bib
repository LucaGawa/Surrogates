  abstract = {We compare two theoretically distinct approaches to generate artificial (or “surrogate”) data for testing hypotheses about a given data set. The first and more straightforward approach is to fit a single “best” model to the original data, and then to generate surrogate data sets that are “typical realizations” of that model. The second approach concentrates not on the model but directly on the original data; it attempts to constrain the surrogate data sets so that they exactly agree with the original data for a specified set of sample statistics. Examples of these two approaches are provided for two simple cases; a test for deviations from a gaussian distribution, and a test for serial dependence in a time series. Additionally, we consider test for nonlinearity in time series based on a Fourier transform (FT) method and on more conventional autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) fits to the data. The comparative performance of hypothesis testing schemes based on these two approaches is found to depend on whether or not the discriminating statistic is pivotal. A statistic is “pivotal” if its distribution is the same for all processes consistent with the null hypothesis. The typical-realization method requires that the discriminating statistic satisfy this property. The constrained-realization approach, on the other hand, does not share this requirement, and can provide an accurate and powerful test without having to sacrifice flexibility in the choice of discriminating statistic.}

  abstract = {The availability of time series of the evolution of the properties of physical systems is increasing, stimulating the development of many novel methods for the extraction of information about their behaviour over time, including whether or not they arise from deterministic or stochastic dynamical systems. Surrogate data testing is an essential part of many of these methods, as it enables robust statistical evaluations to ensure that the results observed are not obtained by chance, but are a true characteristic of the underlying system. The surrogate data technique is based on the comparison of a particular property of the data (a discriminating statistic) with the distribution of the same property calculated in a set of constructed signals (surrogates) which match the original data set but do not possess the property that is being tested. Fourier transform based surrogates remain the most popular, yet many more options have since been developed to test increasingly varied null hypotheses while characterizing the dynamics of complex systems, including uncorrelated and correlated noise, coupling between systems, and synchronization. Here, we provide a detailed overview of a wide range of surrogate types, discuss their practical applications and demonstrate their use in both numerically simulated and real experimental systems. We also compare the performance of various surrogate types for the detection of nonlinearity, synchronization and coherence, coupling strength between systems, and the nature of coupling. A MatLab toolbox for many of the surrogate methods is provided.}

  abstract  = {The schemes for the generation of surrogate data in order to
               test the null hypothesis of linear stochastic process undergoing
               nonlinear static transform are investigated as to their
               consistency in representing the null hypothesis. In particular,
               we pinpoint some important caveats of the prominent algorithm of
               amplitude adjusted Fourier transform surrogates (AAFT) and
               compare it to the iterated AAFT, which is more consistent in
               representing the null hypothesis. It turns out that in many
               applications with real data the inferences of nonlinearity after
               marginal rejection of the null hypothesis were premature and
               have to be reinvestigated taking into account the inaccuracies
               in the AAFT algorithm, mainly concerning the mismatching of the
               linear correlations. In order to deal with such inaccuracies, we
               propose the use of linear together with nonlinear polynomials as
               discriminating statistics. The application of this setup to some
               well-known real data sets cautions against the use of the AAFT
               algorithm.},
